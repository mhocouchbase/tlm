    #
    # End classic cbdeps. Note: the following cbdeps packags are build-only
    # requirements and hence aren't captured for the Black Duck report:
    #     maven
    #     protoc-gen-go
    #
    # We also don't include RocksDB as it is only used by internal testing
    # builds, not shipped.
    #

    # Include these here even though they're actually included in the builds
    # by server-linux-build.sh.
    libgcc: [ 7.3.1 ]
    libstdc++: [ 7.3.1 ]
